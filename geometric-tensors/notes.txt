-- finite dimensional Hilbert spaces
-- assumption that \lambda -> H(\lambda) is smooth
  -- not unreasonable; even in the presence of level crossings
  -- level crossings should not occur unless in the thermodynamic limit at
     phase transition
  -- discontinuous ground state change => level crossing in finite system (?)
-- <psi|\partial psi> is purely imaginary, due to normalisation
-- explain inequality derivation
-- what does "local" mean for $\delta H$? not a clue
  -- might not matter: inequality is not tight
-- Q_\mu\nu/L^d can be finite in the thermodynamic limit even for gapless systems
-- extension to finite temperature [??]
